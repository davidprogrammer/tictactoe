click on ScalaJavaFxApp2.scala for the most recent update, containing a tic tac toe game using a GUI
click on tictactoe.scala for the same game only with no GUI, working from the console this time

The next step would be to do away with the listviews, and intead use a GUI, meaning the program would show you a 3x3 grid and you would be able to click on any space you want (instead of choosing the space from a list view, like it is now), choose your side (or even better have it chosen for you based on whos turn it is), and have that space turn into either a 'X' or an 'O'
